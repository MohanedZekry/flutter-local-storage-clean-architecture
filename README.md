## Intro ##
<i> In this project we will use trending local storage packages We’ll do some benchmarking to determine how long it takes each option to perform operations, so we can have a clear understanding of which is the best choice for us. 
The project is implementing  a clean architecture so that it’s easy to understand and easy to change as the project grows in the future and implement new technologies or packages.
